I've been programming in one form or another since 1980, started using D3 to create visualizations for the classes I teach around 2012, discovered Observable while it was still in beta in 2018, and was part of the *first* Observable Ambassador cohort.

I also maintain several other sites that use Observable Framework and/or D3.  These include

- [WNC Viz](https://wncviz.com), my professional site in data visualization consultancy,
- [The WNC Viz Blog](https://blog.wncviz.com), which is a separate Framework project, and
- [Mark's Math](https://marksmath.org), my academic website.



*I'd like to think I have something worth saying about Observable Framework.*

So, this is where I'm going to say those things - right here in the Observable Cloud.
